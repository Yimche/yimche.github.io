## Hello World!
A very generic way to start a blog, I know. 

Documenting thoughts, code, and ideas. Again, very original, I know, but I felt
inspired, and this seemed like a fun side project. There's really no serious 
repercussion to this so it's not the end of the world if I brick the page.

So I guess that's my hello world! :D
